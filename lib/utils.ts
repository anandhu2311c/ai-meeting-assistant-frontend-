Analyze this conversation and determine:
1. Is there a clear question being asked?
2. Do you have sufficient knowledge to provide a comprehensive answer?
3. Or would you need external documents/context to give a complete response?

Respond with ONLY one of these formats:
- "KNOWN: [brief answer preview]" - if you can answer comprehensively
- "NEED_CONTEXT: [what specific information you need]" - if you need external sources

Examples:
- For "What is React?" → "KNOWN: React is a JavaScript library..."
- For "What's my GPA?" → "NEED_CONTEXT: Personal academic information"
- For "Company policy on remote work?" → "NEED_CONTEXT: Specific company policies"`;
