# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local and update the values

# Backend API URL (required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: All backend-specific environment variables (API keys, database URLs, etc.)
# should be configured in the backend .env file, not here.
# Frontend only needs the API URL to communicate with the backend.
