# Groq Migration Complete

## Overview

Successfully migrated the AI Interview Assistant from Claude (Anthropic) to Groq for LLM reasoning responses. This change provides faster response times and reduces API costs while maintaining high-quality AI reasoning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation

- Installed `groq-sdk` package for Groq API integration
- Removed dependency on `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (kept for now but no longer used)

### 2. New Groq Library (`lib/groq.ts`)

Created a new Groq client library with:

- Groq client initialization with API key
- Model configuration: `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` (default) and `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fast)
- Streaming and non-streaming helper functions
- Temperature and token limit settings optimized for interview responses

### 3. API Route Migration (`app/api/completion/route.ts`)

Updated the completion endpoint to use Groq instead of Claude:

- **Import changes**: Replaced Claude imports with Groq imports
- **Streaming logic**: Adapted to Groq's streaming response format
- **Error handling**: Updated error messages to reference Groq instead of Claude
- **Response format**: Modified to handle Groq's `choices[0].delta.content` structure

### 4. Environment Configuration

Updated `.env.example` to include:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

## Technical Details

### Model Selection

- **Primary Model**: `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` - High-quality responses for complex reasoning
- **Fast Model**: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` - Ultra-fast responses (available for future optimization)

### Response Streaming

Groq streaming format:

```typescript
for await (const chunk of groqStream) {
  const content = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content;
  if (content) {
    // Process content chunk
  }
}
```

### Configuration

- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity/consistency)
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 (same as Claude)
- **Stream**: Enabled for real-time responses

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Speed**: Groq's inference is significantly faster than Claude
2. **Cost**: Lower API costs compared to Claude
3. **Reliability**: Groq has excellent uptime and availability
4. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time applications like interview assistance

## Setup Instructions

1. **Get Groq API Key**:

   - Visit [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Generate an API key

2. **Configure Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Add to your .env file
   GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Test the Integration**:
   - Start the application
   - Trigger an AI response through the chat interface
   - Verify Groq is being used in the console logs

## Compatibility

- All existing RAG functionality remains intact
- Citations and context handling unchanged
- Error handling and fallbacks preserved
- UI/UX remains identical - only the backend LLM changed

## Files Modified

1. `lib/groq.ts` (new)
2. `app/api/completion/route.ts` (updated)
3. `.env.example` (updated)
4. `package.json` (groq-sdk dependency added)

## Next Steps

1. Add Groq API key to environment variables
2. Test the complete interview flow
3. Monitor response quality and adjust temperature if needed
4. Consider using the faster `llama-3.1-8b-instant` model for specific use cases

## Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The AI Interview Assistant now uses Groq for all LLM reasoning responses, providing faster and more cost-effective AI interactions while maintaining the same high-quality experience.
